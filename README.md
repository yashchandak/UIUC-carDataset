# UIUC-carDataset
It contains the C++ source code and the bounding box results for both multiScale and fixed Scale test images. It requires OpenCV Library to be installed. The classifiers are also provided in case anyone wants to replicate/improvise/modify the results.

The code is not clean or commented as of now, please feel to ask any questions regarding it.

Please make appropriate changes in the code to load images and save results on your system.
Certain parts of code were used to generate results in the format to be used by the HPU developed by our team. Please ignore those.

Use the default evaluator provided by the UIUC dataset to get the results.
